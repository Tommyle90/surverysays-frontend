### Survey Says!

----

Survey says app allows users to create a survey questions and get answers for them. A signed-in user creates a survey and can be able to update or delete their own surveys. All signed-in users can only view a survey and have an option to answer them. You can try it out using:

### Technologies used
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS/Sass
- Ajax



### Planning Process
We used scrum to plan our project and work closely. We first did the ERD and wireframes and part out the works that needs to be done. We deligate the works to each of us and whenever there is a problem we come together and try to solve it or put out an issue queue. At the beginning and end of the day we discuss the works that are done and needs to be done after. Team work made this app work!!!

### Development Process
We started out by creating scripts for answer and survey. By using handlebars system is protected from cross-site scripting. Forms are created
in order for the user to create, view, update and delete a survey. Events are created in order to display the answer and keep count of the result.
UI is created inorder for the user to be able to see different messages whenever they made any changes on the interface.
